# Welcome to DesignSprint UX!
Hello! My name is [Abhishek Shrivastava](https://www.iitg.ac.in/shri/), and I am your moderator for this course. During this DesignSprint, we will attempt to develop a shared understanding of the User Experience Design - in terms of its concepts, process, guidelines and applications. 
## Our Roadmap
### Topics to be covered

- Goal Directed Design Process
  - User Research
  - 
- Standards and Guidelines Evaluation Techniques

### Hands-on exercises
- **Design analysis:** We have seen how different interactive products and services vary in terms of emphasis on *form*, *content* and *behavior*. Let us individually create a nine-slide presentation covering images of interactive products and services. Each slide should have an image of a single product or service. It should be complemented with the text mentioning the emphasis on *form*, *content* and *behavior*.
- Practicing User Research Techniques
- Design modelling
- Design Evaluation
