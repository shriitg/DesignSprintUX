# Welcome to DesignSprint UX!
Hello! My name is [Abhishek Shrivastava](https://www.iitg.ac.in/shri/), and I am your moderator for this course. During this DesignSprint, we will attempt to develop a shared understanding of the User Experience Design - in terms of its concepts, process, guidelines and applications. 

However before we begin lets get certain things in order first. As a course facilitator, I would be very much interested in knowing about the course participants. I request you to respond to a [profile form](#) and let me know some of your profile details. This will help me shape up the instructions and moderate interactions for better outcomes.
