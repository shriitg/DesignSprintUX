# Welcome to DesignSprint UX!
Hello! My name is [Abhishek Shrivastava](https://www.iitg.ac.in/shri/), and I am your moderator for this course. During this DesignSprint, we will attempt to develop a shared understanding of the User Experience Design - in terms of its concepts, process, guidelines and applications.

## Hands-on exercises and assignments
- **Design analysis** 
  - We have seen how different interactive products and services vary in terms of emphasis on *form*, *content* and *behavior*. Let us now create a nine-slide presentation covering images of interactive products and services. Each slide should have an image of a single product or service. It should be complemented with the text mentioning the emphasis on *form*, *content* and *behavior*. Attempt this assignment in groups.
  - Write, or illustrate a short story depicting your understanding of the designs based on Mental model. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0p87xpqcg0pz7x/The%20Great%20Mental%20Model.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank">View Example</a>
- **Design Process**
  - Create a research plan with details of different steps for a chosen application. Choose an application with limited scope. Group assignment ~ 60 min.
  - Sketch screens for your chosen application illustrating 2 key-path scenarios. ~ 30 min.
  - Evaluate your sketches based on Key Path Scenario using one of the evaluation methods, preferably cognitive walkthroughs. ~ 40 min.
