## Welcome to DesignSprint UX

My name is [Abhishek Shrivastava](https://www.iitg.ac.in/shri/). I am your course facilitator. During this designSprint we will attempt to develop a shared understanding of the User Experience Design, in terms of its concepts, process, guidelines and applications. 
However before we do that, I would like to get a sense of who are the course participants. Please take a few minutes to tell me about your profiles to help me understand you better as an audience for this course.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shriitg/designSprintUX/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
