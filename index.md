## Welcome to DesignSprint UX

Hello! My name is [Abhishek Shrivastava](https://www.iitg.ac.in/shri/), and I am your course facilitator. During this DesignSprint, we will attempt to develop a shared understanding of the User Experience Design - in terms of its concepts, process, guidelines and applications. 
However before we begin lets get certain things in order first. As a course facilitator, I would be very much interested in knowing about the course participants. I request you to respond to a [profile form](#) and let me know some of your profile details. This will help me shape up the instructions and moderate interactions for better outcomes. 
By the way, here is the list of things we have planned to do during this DesignSprint.
```markdown
- activity 1
- activity 2
- activity 3
- activity 4
- activity 5
- activity 6
```
However before we do that, I would like to get a sense of who are the course participants. Please take a few minutes to tell me about your profiles to help me understand you better as an audience for this course.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
